### Edit some key files

- [ ] 1. In `index.Rmd`, change YOUR TITLE HERE to your title. 

- [ ] 2. In `index.Rmd`, change YOUR NAME HERE to your name.

- [ ] 3. In `_bookdown.yml`, change YOUR GITHUB USERNAME to your GitHub username in the two places it appears.

- [ ] 4. In `_bookdown.yml`, change YOUR GITHUB REPO to your GitHub repo name in the two places it appears.

(Note that 3. and 4. provide links to the `.Rmd` files of your project for editing and viewing. If you move your `.Rmd` files you will need to update these file paths. Once your book is rendered, test that the edit (pen) and view (eye) buttons work.)

- [ ] 5. In `_output.yml`, change YOUR SHORT TITLE to a shortened version of your title. (Leave the "after:" line indicating that the book was published with bookdown as is.)

### Render the book

- [ ] 1. Install **bookdown** with `install.packages("bookdown")`. If you already have it, update to the [latest version](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bookdown).

- [ ] 2. Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`.

- [ ] 3. Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

- [ ] 4. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub. 

(You will need to repeat steps 2 and 4 every time you wish to update the book online.)

### Edit README

Once you've completed these steps, delete the content of this **README** and add a short description of your project with a link to the book URL. It would be appreciated if you add the following to the end:

*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/bookdown-template.*

(And starring the repo would be nice too so I can see if this is getting used or not!)
