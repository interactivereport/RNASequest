This pipeline contains three main tools: EAinit: Generate a set of project analysis files based on a DNAnexus result folder; EAqc: Analyze the covariates against the expression to determine if the expression is needed to be adjusted; EArun: Produce QuickOmics object for webserver loading.

There will be five files in the result folder: compareInfo.csv: an empty comparison definition file (with header). Please fill in this file before EArun call. config.yml: a config fill specifies the parameters of the EAqc and EArun. Please update covariates_adjust after EAqc. geneAnnotation.csv: a gene annotation file including gene symbol. sampleMeta.csv: a sample meta information file, please feel free to add additional columns whose column names should be considered to be added into covariates_check in config.yml. alignQC.pdf: plots generated from alignment QC metrics. Please pay attention on the std out messages. 4.2 EAqc EAqc Path/to/a/config/file The execution of the command with the above default config file, expression PC analysis will be done against covariates specified in covariates_check in config.yml file. An excel file will list p-value for all numeric and categorical covariates, and with significant ones will be in plot pdf files. The analysis before covariate adjusting will have prefix covariatePCanalysis_noAdjust. Based on the above results, you can add covariates into covariates_adjust in config.yml file, and run EAqc again. This time additional expression PC analysis will be applied to covariate adjusted expression with files started with covariatePCanalysis_Adjusted. Please pay attention on the std out messages. 4.3 EArun EArun Path/to/a/config/file Please fill the compareInfo.csv before executing the above command The execution of above command will produce R object for QuickOmics webserver to load. The process will generate the covariate adjusted logTPM for visualization; complete differentially expressed gene analysis and gene network generation. The results (three files) currently will need to be copied to a folder on ngs, in order to have web accession. Please pay attention on the std out messages.
