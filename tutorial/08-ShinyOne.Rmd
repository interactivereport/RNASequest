# ShinyOne

We also developed ShinyOne which is a R Shiny App displaying a web-based searchable table that lists all projects processed by RNASequest and loaded into Quickomics, with Quickomics launching link for each project. 

In the backend of Quickomics, we added the capability to load projects directly from URLs after the data files have been saved at user-specified server locations. Together, ShinyOne and URL loading enable many projects to be powered by one Quickomics instance.

Please use the following link to access ShinyOne:
