# Online slide deck

Powered by reveal.js, the online slide deck is an R markdown template utilized by RNASequest to generate an interactive slide deck with emphasis on the graphical representation of QC and basic analysis plots, which makes the primary analysis presentation-ready for engaging biologists to discuss the initial results immediately. Again, it is also GitHub-friendly in terms of hosting.

Please visit an example of the online slide deck using the following link:

Here is the tutorial to create your own slide deck after running the EA pipeline:

**1, Find the path of the bookdown.info.txt file, it is located in:**

```
***/YourPorjectName/EA******/BookdownReport/bookdown.info.txt
```

**2, Install the required package: [revealjs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/revealjs/index.html){target="_blank"}**

```
conda activate ExpressionAnalysis

# Type 'R' to activate the R program in terminal
R
> install.packages(“revealjs”)

# After installation, quit the R session without saving the workspace
> quit()
Save workspace image? [y/n/c]: n
```

**3, Go to the RNASequest/src dir, and modify line #29 of script ‘Slidedeck.Rmd’:**

```
info_txt <- <your bookdown.info.txt path>
```

**4, Finally render the slide deck:**

The slide deck [Slidedeck.Rmd](https://github.com/interactivereport/RNASequest/blob/main/src/Slidedeck.Rmd){target="_blank"} script is under the /src directory of the RNASequest installation.

```
Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("~/RNASequest/src/Slidedeck.Rmd", output_file="yourslidedeck_name.html")'
```

Then it will generate **yourslidedeck_name.html** for visualization.
