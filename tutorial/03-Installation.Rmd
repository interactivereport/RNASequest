# Installation

Download RNASequest from GitHub and add it to the environment:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/interactivereport/RNASequest.git
cd RNASequest

#Install RNASequest conda environment
#Please make sure you have conda installed before, and this step may take a while
bash install

#Activate the conda environment
conda activate ExpressionAnalysis

#Check the path of current directory and add it to $PATH:
CurrentDir=`pwd`
export PATH="$CurrentDir:$PATH"

#However, the above command only adds the RNASequest directory to $PATH temporarily
#To add it to the environment permanently, edit ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc:
vim ~/.bash_profile
#Add the full path of the RNASequest directory to $PATH, for exammple, $HOME/RNASequest
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/RNASequest
#Source the file
source ~/.bash_profile
```
