# Introduction

ExpressionAnalysis (EA) is a Converter from a set of RNAseq analysis output to QuickOmics (http://quickomics.bxgenomics.com) for interactive visualization.

This pipeline contains four main scripts:

  - **EAinit**
  
    This is the first step of the pipeline. First, it creates a directory storing files necessary for the future steps.
    
    By default, the directory will be named based on the date when running the pipeline. For example, EA20220328_0 will be created since today is 2022-03-28. If the user runs EA again for the same dataset, the last digit will add up to avoid duplications: EA20220328_1
    
    
  - **EAqc**
  
    This is the second step of the pipeline. 
    
    It analyzes the covariates against the expression to determine if the expression is needed to be adjusted.
  
  
  - **EArun**
  
    After running EAqc, this following EArun step will perform differential expression analysis based on defined groups.
    
    It also produces QuickOmics objects for webserver loading.


  - **EAreport**
  
    The last step, EAreport, will generate a user-friendly bookdown report to visualize the EA pipeline results.
