# Volcano plots

This volcano plot reveals the differentially expressed genes provided in the input data file. By default, the Fold change Cutoff is set to 1.2 and the P value Cutoff is set to 0.01. Users have the option to change any of these parameters.

The red dots are indicative of all genes that pass the Fold Change and P value cutoff, while the green dots are indicative of genes that only pass the P value cutoff. Fifty random genes are labelled for both the up-regulated and down-regulated genes by default.
