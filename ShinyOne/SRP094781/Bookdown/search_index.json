This is a summary report generated by EAreport (part of Expression Analysis) using Bookdown. This report contains basic plots and tables generated by the pipeline. Project overview Here is a brief overview of the project: Project Name: SRP094781 Species: human Description: **** Number of Samples: 109 Number of Groups: 4 Number of Genes/Proteins: 51264 Number of Comparisons: 3 Number of Samples in Each Group: grp2 grp3 grp1 grp4 count 34 23 48 4 Project files The EA pipeline also produced several files under the working directory: notAdjusted_Covariate_PC_Results.rds notAdjusted_Covariate_PC_Results.xlsx notAdjusted_PCA_Plots.pdf notAdjusted_Significant_Categorical_Covariates.pdf notAdjusted_Significant_Numeric_Covariates.pdf sequenceQC.pdf sequenceQC.unionTop.TPM.csv For more flexible and interactive visualization, please upload the following Rdata files to Quickomics. SRP094781_estCount.rds SRP094781_network.RData SRP094781.RData SRP094781.csv The following sections are included in this bookdown report: QC plots Covariates PCA plots Volcano plots Heatmap plots "],["qc-plots.html", "Chapter 1 QC plots 1.1 Top gene ratio 1.2 Top expressed genes", " Chapter 1 QC plots Quality control (QC) is critical to examine the basic QC metrics of the data. In this section, we present several QC plots to visualize the quality of each dataset within the project. The first set of QC plots show the Top Gene Ratios. There are always top genes in the samples, and we are usually interested in knowing what are they, and how do they drive the overall expression profiles. Thus, these three top gene ratio plots are useful to determine what the percentage of the Top 1, 10 and 30 genes in the overall TPM. Since the sum of TPM values will always be 1 million, the percentage of TPM value indicates how these genes influence the RNA content detected in the samples. To better narrow down the top genes, the second set of QC plots shows the list of Top Genes and their expression ranges, for TPM and counts (if the counts information is available). Since there may be multiple samples across the whole project, here, we present the union of top 10 genes, to make sure at least 10 genes will be plotted. The user can easily pinpoint what are those highly expressed genes, and learn how they express across all samples. It would be beneficial to notice that certain tissues should have a signature of highly expressed genes, and these plots may serve as a quality checking step of the current dataset. 1.1 Top gene ratio The following three plots present the Top N (1, 10, 30) gene ratios using the percentage (%) of TPM. 1.1.1 Top1 % of Total TPM 1.1.2 Top10 % of Total TPM 1.1.3 Top30 % of Total TPM 1.2 Top expressed genes The following plots present the union of top 10 expressed genes across samples in the project. We used 10 genes by default because if the project contains a couple of samples, the union of top genes may result in a long list. Here, we ensure at least 10 genes to plot, but won’t be too many even if this project is large. 1.2.1 Top genes by TPM 1.2.2 Top genes by counts "],["covariates.html", "Chapter 2 Covariates 2.1 List of covariates 2.2 Plots of significant covariates", " Chapter 2 Covariates This Covariates chapter provides flexibility to visualize the covariates in the current dataset, such as Age, Group, Genotype, etc. This dynamic table contains several columns, including the PC, Covariate, Type, Significance, p-value, and FDR for each covariate listed. The PC column shows the principal component that the covariate belongs to. We will see the same covariate name appears in different PC, such as PC1 and PC2, with different Significance. The Covariate column displays the name of each covariate, and the terms are self-explainable. For example, some covariates are the sample annotation of the dataset, such as Age, Group, Genotype. On the other hand, some covariates are related to the data analysis steps, such as the metrics from the genome mapping step. If the data is downloaded from GEO and incorporated into the pipeline using recount3, metrics from the recount3 pipeline will also show up in the Covariate column. The Type column indicates the type of each covariate. Covariates can be Numeric or Categorical types. The Significance column lists the ANOVA FDR information between each covariate v.s. PC. For Numeric covariates, an r value is associated with each ANOVA test. However, for Categorical covariates, only FDR values are displayed. The last two columns, P-value and FDR, indicate the results of statistical tests (P-value) and adjusted P-values. 2.1 List of covariates Table 2.1: Significant covariates PC Covariate Type Significance P-value FDR PC1 recount_qc_star_number_of_splices_at_ac Numeric recount_qc_star_number_of_splices_at_ac vs. PC1: r=-0.544;

"],["pca-plots.html", "Chapter 3 PCA plots 3.1 General PCA plot 3.2 PCA plots by covariates", " Chapter 3 PCA plots In this chapter, we present Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results of all samples in the current dataset. Principle component analysis is a powerful method in exploratory data analysis, by visualizing complex datasets in lower dimensions. Thus it is also a useful method for dimension reduction, preserving critical information on the similarities and differences between all samples. For more information, please check the Wiki page. The percentage of PC1 or PC2 indicates how much proportion of variance in the dataset can be explained by each PC. Usually, PC1 can explain most of the variance, but for complex data with more noises, we also rely upon PC2 for better separation. The PCA plot displays, by default, the first 2 PCs in the dataset, labels the data names, and colors study groups. From this plot, we are able to examine the consistency of samples within the same group, and identify potential outliers. The separation of groups on the PCA plot also indicates the differences between them, and this trend should be consistent with the differential expression analysis, i.e., two groups with higher divergence should have more significantly changed genes. 3.1 General PCA plot In this section, we plot a single PCA figure to visualize the default covariate, usually by the group information. 3.2 PCA plots by covariates In this section, we display PCA plots colored by different covariates. The PC1 and PC2 values are same across all plots, but the color panels are different.

The x-axis is the Log2 Fold change, which shows the increase and decrease of genes within the current comparison. The values that are deviated from zero mean larger expression changes. The y-axis is the -Log10(Padj.Value), and the higher value corresponds to a smaller adjusted P-value, i.e., higher significace. This volcano plot reveals the differentially expressed genes after running the DE analysis by EArun. By default, the Fold change Cutoff is set to 1.2, and the adjusted P-value Cutoff is set to 0.05. The Red dots are indicative of all genes that pass the Fold Change and adjusted P-value cutoff, while the Green dots are indicative of genes that only pass the adjusted P-value cutoff. The Grey dots are usually in the middle, and they are not significant genes. By default, fifty random genes are labeled for both the up-regulated and down-regulated genes. Moreover, this chapter will display volcano plots of all comparison groups. There are total 3 comparisons in this project.

In this chapter, we present two different types of heatmap: 1) A heatmap plotted using the top 1000 most variable genes and 2) Heatmaps for significantly changed genes of all comparison groups. In the first heatmap, the variance was calculated for each gene, and then ranked in decreasing order. To reduce the size and plotting time of the heatmap, only the top 1000 most variable genes were chosen. Although genes with large variances may not refect differentially expressed genes among specific comparison groups, they remain meaningful when referring to the global changes within the current dataset. Then we present heatmap(s) of all comparison groups by subsetting the samples. For each comparison, only samples involved in the comparison will be plotted on the heatmap. The number of heatmaps will also be adjusted based on the number of comparisons analyzed by the pipeline. Only the top 1000 significantly changed genes will be plotted if too many different genes are differentially expressed. If no more than 1000 significantly changed genes for the comparison, all significantly changed genes will be plotted. The heatmaps were drawn using the log2(TPM+1) expression values with Z-score transformation. By default, hierarchical clusterings were performed on both row (genes) and column (samples), indicating the similarities between genes and samples. Thus, similar genes and samples will be clustered closely. The heatmaps also display the grouping information provided before running the pipeline. It provides additional information for the users to compare the biological grouping information and the unsupervised hierarchical clustering results. All heatmaps in this chapter were plotted using the same design, and they only differ in the genes and samples selected during the plotting step. 5.1 Heatmap of 1000 most variable genes This heatmap plots the top 1000 most variable genes across all samples. The x-axis displays the sample names, and colors indicate the expression Z-scores, shown as the color bar at the lower right corner. 5.2 Heatmap of all comparisons The heatmaps in this section select the most significant genes to plot, with a maximum of 1000 genes if there are more than 1000 significantly expressed genes. These genes have been pre-computed and selected before running the EAreport step, and they were based on the differential expression analysis results when running EArun.
